EchoWords is a multiplayer word chain game inspired by Shiritori, with a memory twist! Challenge your friends to remember words while building chains where each new word starts with the last letter of the previous word.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Create or join a lobby** with your friends (at least 2 players recommended)
2. **Start the game** and take turns entering words
3. **Chain words together** - each new word must start with the last letter of the previous word
4. **Remember previous words** - you'll need to re-enter words that came before you
5. **Score points** based on word length, typing speed, and remaining time
6. **Beat the timer** - earn bonus time by entering correct words

The game becomes more challenging as the chain grows longer. Can your team remember all the words?
